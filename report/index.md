## Team Organization:

The following sections will only cover the Team Charter and Mission Statement. The rest of the Team Organization can be found in **Appendix A: Team Organization**

**Team Charter:**

Shortly after we assembled our team and got to know one another better we decided to come up with our team charter. In this session, we decided to start talking about the initial goals and ideas for this project. We wanted to be able to determine our metrics of success to which we could come back to at the end of the semester and see if we achieved our goals. We each discussed our goals and noticed a lot of similarities between our ideals for this project. After careful consideration, we decided upon the following team charter.

_“With the presentation of our projects at the Innovation Showcase, our team is looking to create a professional deliverable that has a strong visual appeal to judges. We hope to develop strong skills in tools used by engineers currently in the workforce, such as GitHub, Cadence, and the various other software that will be utilized in this class, and to display our accomplishments using these tools in a clear way. By creating a product that is thoughtfully designed, we hope to hone our abilities as engineers and demonstrate our capabilities to industry members at the innovation showcase.”_

**Mission Statement:**

After we did the Charter, we decided to move on to the mission statement and decide our primary goal for this project. We took some of our ideas from the Team Charter and attempted to condense them into a singular statement. A problem we ran into was that we were not fully aware of what the scope of the final project would be so made some assumptions, based on project requirements and initial design ideas. After using the provided references we decided on the following mission statement:

_“To create an effective product that will accurately and quickly collect weather-based data.”_

## User Needs:

Viewing market options in weather sensor equipment allowed our team to perform benchmarking for our project concepts and generate user needs by analyzing real product reviews. Our team looked at five different available commercial solutions generated from Amazon searches and their product reviews to generate a list of needs from the customer’s own words. Both positive and negative reviews were viewed to determine what features in a weather sensor were desired and what should be cut or was missing from most products. 

**Need Generation and Sorting:**

Reading user reviews with the perspective of generating project features was most important to us. Since the scope of the project was fairly undefined with the exception of budget and the overarching requirements listed for the course, the team viewed amazon reviews, looking for requested features, as well as what the users viewed as extraneous on the products we reviewed. Looking for explicitly listed needs, as well as digging deeper into the wording of the reviews to see latent needs from the users. From these reviews, we generated a list of 103 needs, as seen in **Figure A**.

</div>

</figure>

<p align="center">Figure A: Full list of Generated Needs</p>

From this full list, we sorted these needs into six different categories: Hardware, Software, Interactivity/User Experience, Customization, Manufacturing, and Safety. These categories were chosen based on the aspect sections we included in our Product Requirements Document which was written following the review of our sorted user needs. Shown below in **Figure B** is our sorted list for the Hardware section, and the full list of sorted needs can be found in Appendix B: User Needs and Benchmarking.

</div>

</figure>

<p align="center">Figure B: Hardware category of sorted user needs</p>
  
From these sorted needs, our team ranked the needs into three separate weights, with one to three stars denoting importance. The weight of a specific need was chosen by our team, with the greatest ranking given to needs that were generated from project requirements and effective functionality, as these were non-negotiable features for our final deliverable. Without including the three star needs, our project would fail to meet stated requirements or would lack qualities that would make it a functional or usable product. Below in **Figure C** is the evolution of the Hardware section, now ranked.

<p align="center">Figure C: Ranked List of Hardware Needs</p>
  
Now with our generated list of user needs sorted and ranked, our team looked to characterize and formalize the project and needs through the construction of a Project Requirements Document, which would provide the background, objectives, and potential stakeholder experiences with our project. Although we felt that our main stakeholders ranged from Industry members to hobbyists, we chose to imagine the project’s use from the perspective of a field engineer as well as a student for our use case scenarios. 
  
Our list of sorted needs were kept in their sorted categories for the PRD, and converted to project aspects for reviewing final project success. These were given priorities based on the weight assigned to them during the ranking process, although since the scale ranged from P1-P10 instead of 1-3 stars, we were able to create more depth within our aspect ranking. 
  
The full PRD can be found in **Appendix C: Project Requirements Document**


## Design Ideation:

**Idea Generation:**

We initiated our design ideation by generating one hundred design ideas. These ideas can be viewed below in **Figure D.**

Idea Sortation and Ranking:
Once we had generated our 100 design ideas, we proceeded to sort them into three categories. These categories being miscellaneous, weather balloon, and drone which can be viewed respectively in **Figure E**, **Figure F**, and **Figure G**. After this process, we ranked our ideas vertically from the most to least practical. A few of the aspects we looked for in practicality were ease of implementation, feasibility, and requirement satisfaction.

**Concept 1: Weather Balloon**

Aiden Lynch was in charge of the Weather Balloon design concept. The fundamental idea is that we have a system attached to a balloon that will be able to sense multiple different environmental factors at different altitudes. See **Figure H** below for the picture of the figure and for a description of the device.

<figure class="image">  

<div style="text-align: center">  

<img src="reportphotos/WeatherBalloonMockup.jpg" width="50%"><br>  

</div>

</figure>

<p align="center">Figure H: Weather Balloon</p>

We have the balloon that will raise the device up in the sky to collect readings. We are discussing whether to use an actual weather balloon, a helium balloon, or a biodegradable balloon to limit waste. We have a strong string/rope that will connect the balloon to the top of the box whether it be on a hook or another method with a closed top. We have two currently undefined weather-based sensors that will be connected to the PCB inside of the unit inside the box. Connected to the top we have a bidirectional motor that will be the actuation and will be in charge of cutting the rope to bring the device back for the users. We also have attached a GPS tracker that will be utilized through wifi to allow us to receive the readings while also being able to track the balloon. Some benefits is that we can use the string at the bottom to accurately measure a variety of different heights by increasing the sting length. Another pro is that it is a very visually appealing project and very easy to understand the fundamental idea of how it works. The biggest con we believe is retrieval of the box if it gets too high and the non-wasting of balloons during testing.

**Concept 2: Water Buoy**

Finnton Wentworth visualized concept #2, a floating water based sensor array. The device would be able to collect a physical sample of water as well as transmitting various environmental data. 

<figure class="image">

<img src="reportphotos/BuoyConceptB.png" width="50%"><br>  

</div>

</figure>

<p align="center">Figure I: Water Buoy </p>

Design concept #2 looks to act as a deployable water quality and condition sensor. The user would place the buoy in a body of water to collect and transmit data based on the attached sensors. The main point of actuation is in a sample collection bay door, which sits under the surface of the water. Once the door closes, the water sample can be collected later when the device is retrieved for lab analysis.

The microcontroller and batteries will be stored in a sealed chamber within the main housing of the device, with wires running out connecting to the motor, lights, and external sensors, and sealed to prevent water from damaging the electronics. The body of the device will be constructed from some waterproof material, most likely printed PLA. One major risk of this design is damage to the sensitive components due to moisture or water. Some inexpensive moisture control strategies would be including silica gel packets within the electronics housing. 

**Concept 3: Drone**

Glen Stevens was in charge of the Drone kit design concept. The idea was to create a kit that could be attached to a drone that would then read weather conditions as the drone flew around. See **Figure J** below for a model of the concept.

<figure class="image">  

<div style="text-align: center">  

<img src="reportphotos/DroneMockup.jpg" width="50%"><br>  

</div>

</figure>

<p align="center">Figure J: Drone Kit</p>

The idea for the drone is to take advantage of a drone’s capabilities to reach different altitudes quickly and be programmed to take a certain flight path. We would attach numerous sensors to the drone and try to upgrade its chassis and casing if need be. It would be collecting data from these sensors and storing them on an SD card and then transferring them over wifi once it can connect.

The main concepts are shown in the image, but some could not be included due to them being internal components. These include a rechargeable battery, a way to track the drone using GPS, some form of collision detection, implementing PID control from the rotors, implementing Lidar to try and prevent collisions, the ability to sync with multiple drones, on-board encryption for the data(specifically the GPS data), a way to prevent the drone from accidentally flying into restricted airspace, returning to base in case of a low battery, a gyroscope for stability, and a way to remotely control the drone.

An example of usage would be wanting to track weather patterns in an area throughout a day. A user would set a flight path for the drone or even use a pre-programmed flight path (such as a grid pattern or a figure eight) and it would collect data throughout the day, autonomously returning to recharge and transfer any data it had collected. The user could change the height it operates at, to check weather patterns closer to the ground or higher up.

The wide range of design concepts we discussed and ideated as a team looked to address the open nature of the user needs we generated. Since the generated user needs asked for clear, accurate information collection from their device, we looked to provide products that would provide data collection in a variety of environments before deciding on a project direction. By exploring options in field deployable weather devices in a variety of environments, our team explored the possibilities of various sensor arrays that would stay within design requirements. The generated concepts, however, provided design difficulties our team was worried about addressing.



## Selected Design:

After our Checkpoint 1 presentation we decided to sit down and really evaluate how we were going to implement our project. We were at the time very confident that we were going to end up doing the Weather Balloon Idea. However, when we sat down and decided to implement the idea, the concept of the Balloon Budget and the safety of the device became fundamental problems that rendered our idea unusable. We could not ensure the protection of the device with our budget. After that revelation, we decided we had to rework our idea. We took the original idea that was the base of the balloon and then decided to make that a stationary object. Once we decided that the possibilities of what we could design expanded drastically. After many looks at our User Needs, Project Requirements Document, and our Ideas, we came up with the idea in **Figure K**

**Image**

<p align="center">Figure K: Selected Design Idea</p>

With this idea we have all of our sensors on the elevated layer that collects the readings. When the humidity or temperature reaches a certain value, the motor in the center turns the dome so it is a completely sealed area and prevents any future damage to the device. In the following sections, we will be going into more depth on the specifics of our design.

## Block Diagram:

After we decided on our idea we needed to determine the subsystems and how the idea will operate as a whole. To do this we looked at the individual parts we determined we needed to make this work and split them up. While we did this we referenced the project requirements as well and made sure every part fit the project requirements. The full block diagram which is in **Figure L** has been constantly updated during our project to showcase the most current version.

**Image**

<p align="center">Figure L: Block Diagram</p>

On the block diagram, we have the Temperature and Humidity sensors that use I2C and SPI which fulfill the sensor requirements. We have a motor driver that has bidirectional capability and uses SPI which fulfills the Actuation Requirements. We also have UART communication to the ESP32 module which is also how we will transmit over Wifi. Then we also have the microcontroller that will control the entire system that we picked in the Component Selection part of the process. Each pin of the microcontroller that will be used is described on the diagram, with the specific pin and functionality, from clock pins to digital outputs. We also have a button that serves as a reset button that when pressed will send the device back to default mode. We also have an RGB Led which makes a fun little indicator. This feature is not a part of the project requirements but is there to enhance the experience and provide additional information to the user about the state of the device. The full Block Diagram is located in **Appendix D: Block Diagram**

## Microcontroller Selection:

## Component Selection:

## Hardware Proposal:

After we selected our components we then were able to create the schematic for our final design. To do this we each decided to take our individual subsystems and design those first. We utilized the datasheets and the lessons from our Engineering 304 and 314 classes. After we had an idea of what our final subsystem circuit would look like we decided to verify them on some custom PCBs. To start we designed our subsystem schematic in Cadence’s Capture CIS. While designing we had to create custom symbols and PCB Footprints to represent the parts that we picked during Component Selection. Almost every single component listed in Component Selection needed a custom footprint which we have in a shared folder that will be for the Hardware Proposal and the Final Hardware Implementation. While we were designing we also included the ESP32 and the OLED screen which fulfilled the last 2 parts of the Project Requirements that have not been mentioned. After that was all sorted we designed our individual PCBs in Cadence’s PCB Editor and sent them to manufacturing. The Microcontroller individual subsystem which was created by Finnton Wentworth is shown in **Figure T** and **Figure U.**

<p align="center">Figure U: Microcontroller PCB</p>

After the PCBs were printed we populated them with the components that we ordered in Component Selection. Once we verified that they all worked as intended we met up together and decided to start designing the team schematic. We made any last-minute changes we wanted to make to our individual schematics and then imported them all onto a singular file. One of the key priorities we had while designing our Team Schematic was that we wanted it to be easy to follow. We wanted to have anybody with no prior knowledge of our project to be able to look at it and understand exactly how it worked. A very important part of our project is I2C and SPI communication. To ensure that these worked we made sure that there were pullup Resistors on the I2C bus per the I2C communication specifications, to prevent floating voltages that could cause data corruption. We also made sure to follow the recommended protocols for SPI that were listed on the Microcontroller Datasheet. Our team also included header pins to allow our chip to be programmable using ICSP while it is soldered to the board. The header pins that allow for this are labeled J11 for MCLR and J12 for ICSPDAT and ICSPCLK. After we had our initial design we wanted many different perspectives. We had the teaching team, our peers, and industry professionals review our schematic to make sure it was as thorough and as accurate as possible. After we implemented all of our feedback we designed the Team PCB and had it manufactured. The Team Schematic and Team PCB can be found in Figure V and Figure W.
