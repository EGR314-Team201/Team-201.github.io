# Team Organization- Team 201

## Team Charter:
1. To Create a Working Product that Implements Multiple Serial Communication Sensors
2. To Be Able to Determine Ideal Qualities in a Microcontroller for this and all future projects
3. Display our Team’s Accomplishments in an easy-to-follow GitHub portfolio
4. Create a Professional Deliverable for presentation at the Innovation Showcase
5. Develop Skills in Industry Tools for our Growth as Engineers


With the presentation of our projects at the Innovation Showcase, our team is looking to create a professional deliverable 
that has a strong visual appeal to judges. We hope to develop strong skills in tools used by engineers currently in the workforce, 
such as GitHub, Cadence, and the various other software that will be utilized in this class, and to display our accomplishments using 
these tools in a clear way. By creating a product that is thoughtfully designed, we hope to hone our abilities as engineers and demonstrate 
our capabilities to industry members at the innovation showcase.

## Meeting Coordination
1. What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discord and messaged reminders

2. How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will talk about it in person and then plan to meet those times and update documentation if need be

3. What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face to Face for anything that requires it during the school week and virtual over the weekend for Checkpoint reports and presentations

4. Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary? Describe them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for the team to remain flexible as the project demands it, so keeping notifications on for team communication is vital.

## Team Coordination:

1. Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has "signed off" on each submitted assignment.

a. Everyone has to say they have gone over it in the chat and the last one to check on it will submit it

2. Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and how will you adjust if not?

a. Go over the assignment beforehand and discuss who would be best for what and help those who need some extra help by demonstrations and sending links for helpful material. 

3. Ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team?

a.We will send feedback to our group, and review it as a team for revisions. 

## Team Accountability

1. How will you address missed contributions/assignments/actions?

a. A stern talking to and try to reason with them and hope they can fix it, if it persists then a pink slip will be considered. Work that is not being completed will have to be taken on by the rest of the team.

2. How will you hold one another accountable to the expectations described in this charter?

a. We all have gone through this charter and know what is expected. We will encourage one another and help each other to make sure we all succeed.

3. How will you recognize that a team member is underperforming?

a.Talk to them and understand why they are underperforming and try to help if possible. Direct communication is important, and communicating with the professor will be the last resort, not the first course of action. 

4. How will you help an underperforming team member improve?

a. Understand the exact problem and try to help them come with solutions while still letting them do the work. Sending helpful learning resources will allow them to learn the material that they need to succeed. 

## Conflict Recognition and Resolution

If conflict arises within our group we will talk about it first in a calm and civil manner as a team. If the problem starts to become toxic and a severe problem, conversation with the teaching team may be in order. Our goal is for that not to happen and for everyone to respect one another and come to meaningful conclusions.
