The console also includes an optional temperature and humidity calibration feature for the utmost accuracy.

### Positive Comments

#### Review #1:

“This thermometer system is nothing but the best. I purchased it to monitor the temperatures in different places where water pipes may freeze. An added bonus to the system is that customized high and low alarms can be set for each transmitter channel for the temperature and humidity. In my case I set my alarm to warn me if a temperature reading gets too close to the freezing point. Another nice feature is that if a transmitter fails, it can be easily replaced with a new one without the need of replacing the entire system.”

Customer Needs: 
* Alarms that alert the user if a temperature is being crossed.
* Having Custom Ranges is important for the consumer.
* Parts need to be easily replaceable

#### Review #2:

"It seems reliable so far after using it for 6 months. The 4 remotes were reading all within a degree from each other and can be adjusted on the main unit if needed. I like that they report both degrees and humidity. We use it to measure temp/hum in our garage, inside two dog kennels in the garage and in our heated doghouse out in the yard. The main unit is inside the middle of the house and is about 60ft away from the farthest remote that’s in the yard kennel. It has no problem maintaining contact.
I do also like the flexibility they built in to let the user determine how they want the 4th remote set up: you can set it to alternate between the main unit and the 4th remote. But you can also set it to just show the main unit or just the 4th remote (we set it for this last option). I want to compliment the manufacturer for building in this option because too often nowadays we’re dictated by software programmers working in their little cubical how to use our stuff… The only point for improving I can think of is to make it a bit easier to differentiate between temp and humidity. The display has nice large numbers but they are the same size and shape for both temp and humidity . Maybe make the humidity a little but smaller?"

Customer Needs:
* Long Lifespans so customers do not have to keep buying new ones
* Distinguishable Numbers for the different values we measure 
* Long Range of Connectivity 

#### Review #3

"I have this monitoring 4 freezers and 2 of them are a chest and upright in a detached garage that is 150 feet away and the signal has to travel through 3 walls (not counting the metal doors of the freezers) to the base unit.
In those 2 - I had to suspend the sensors from a shelf and have them facing the door in order to get the range I needed. (NOT the products fault ) The FOURTH wall to get it into the house defeated the system though so I hung it in the garage next to the door where I walk in the house and honestly - I think I prefer it there as to inside the house - I see it every time I walk in the house. Just a side note: Only 3 of the sensors (#'s 2,3 & 4 ) have "temp alarms" (as the instructions tell you ) but I just made sure the #1 sensor was on a freezer that already has an audible temp sensor.( #1 was designed to be the "outside" temperature )
They were super easy to setup - maybe 15 minutes to get them all set and they were all within 2 degrees of what my mechanical thermometers in the freezers said."

Customer Needs:
* Signal Is Strong and Can Reach Anywhere
* Base Unit is Portable to be Seen Everywhere
* Alarms Are Helpful in Case of Problem

### Negative Comments

#### Review #1:

"Remote sensors have no slot for zip tie.
Battery compartment on remote sensor closes with a screw in plastic. Will fail in a few uses.
I was unable to successfully connect more than 2 out of 3 remote sensors at a time.
I consider the product a failure and do not recommend.'

Customer Needs:
* Needs to be easily attachable to things
* Batteries need to be easy to switch out in case if it dies
* Optimal connectivity

#### Review #2:

"It worked as advertised for a few months. I placed the units in three different, covered outdoor aviaries. After a few months. The humidity sensor failed on one. Then another measured 95 degrees, when it was only 85 degrees. One by one each outdoor unit failed. A total waste of our time and money."

Customer Needs:
* Needs to have longevity and not break quickly
* Needs to have accurate readings 
* Outdoor sensors may need more protective than the indoor ones
