**About Us:**

Hi! This is a comprehensive guide of everything we completed throughout the Spring 2023 semester in Embedded Systems and Design II. Our project was a Mobile Sensing System that was supposed to alert the user when ideal mold conditions were present. Our end goal was to present this at the innovation showcase at ASUâ€™s Polytechnic Campus on 4/28/2023. We ended up successfully completing the project and presenting at the innovation showcase. Through this Github you can see all of our assignments and how our project progressed over the course of the semester. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us through our LinkdIn's listed above.
